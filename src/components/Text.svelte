		`Climate change is often spoken about in terms of total earth warming, sea-level rise, and natural disasters. But unless you are a climate scientist, a two degree rise in temperature may not be helpful in providing a tangible vision of our future. <br><br> Perhaps that’s because we’re more familiar with weather: the daily, short-term forecasts that make you pack an extra sweater or wear your rain boots. Climate, on the other hand, describes average weather systems over long periods of time.

		`150 years ago, a German scientist by the name of Wladimir Koppen, attempted to bridge gap between climate and weather, and used vegetation growth to classify the world into 5 distinct climate zones: <br> <b> <span style="color:#ff8563">Arid </span>,<span style="color:#1761fd">Tropical </span>,<span style="color:#abe340">Temperate </span>, <span style="color:#735fca">Cold </span> , <span style="">Polar </span> </b>

		"This became known as the Koppen Climate Classification. Over time, the climate zones were updated (it now includes other variables such as seasonal temperatures, precipitation, elevation amongst others)  and adapted to include 30 subcategories, giving insight into similar climates that exist oceans apart.<br><br> **NOTES: fix colors, hover over the areas to isolate each group and give the name of the group",
		"A quick zoom into Europe, and you can see the diversity of each of these zones. Amersterdam, Madrid, Milan, and Istanbul all have very distinct climates, yet all live within the general classification of Temperate.<br><br> **NOTES: Zoom into Europe, show cities and labels",

		"A recent study, led by climatologist Hylke Beck, used projected data from climate models along with the current Koppen Climate Classification to give a glimpse at what our world may look and feel like in 2070. <br><br> **NOTES: Add text on map that switches between 2023 and 2070",
